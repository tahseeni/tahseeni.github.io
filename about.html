        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Bangladesh, but my parents brought me to Canada when I was 6 months old! After some ups and downs, I currently live in Calgary, AB, Canada.
          </p>

          <p>
            I studied Electrical/Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. I currently work on firmware for GNSS Receivers. I'm really enjoying it so far!
          </p>

        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
          This is my personal website that I made using HTML and CSS. Nothing fancy, just a simple website to "maintain" some blog posts or other thoughts.
          I'd been meaning to redo the design of my initial webpage, but never got around to actually implementing it. I did the design myself, 
          but used AI to figure out the CSS because that stuff's foreign to me!
